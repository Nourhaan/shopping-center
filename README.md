# ShoppingCenter

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.2.11.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone repository
   - git clone https://github.com/Nourhaan/shopping-center.git
   - cd shopping-center

2. Install dependencies
   npm install

3. Run development server
   ng serve

4. Build for production
   ng build

5. Run tests
   - Unit tests: ng test
   - End-to-End tests: ng e2e


## Testing

I have completed all other requirements; testing is the only remaining part.
Due to time constraints, I was not able to implement unit tests (ng test) or end-to-end tests (ng e2e). I focused on delivering as much of the core functionality as possible within the available time.

I am submitting the assessment now, before the allowed 3-day window.
If adding tests is mandatory, please let me know, and I kindly request 2 additional days to complete them, as I have prior commitments on the third day.

Thank you for your understanding.
